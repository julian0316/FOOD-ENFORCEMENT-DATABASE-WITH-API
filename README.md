# Federal Agency’s FDA web-app (ASP.Net, RESTful APIs, C#, JavaScript, SQL Server DB, Azure) 

With this project I developed a ASP.NET web app by Consuming RESTful API’s from Federal agency’s FDA database which provide information 
on removed or corrected products that violated laws.

The app also shows analytical dashboards by consuming RESTful API’s.

This app was deployed on Azure cloud platform.
