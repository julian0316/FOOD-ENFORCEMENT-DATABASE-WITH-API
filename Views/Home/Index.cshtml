    <h2>Food Enforcement Overview</h2>
    <hr />

    <div>
        <p>
            The openFDA food enforcement reports API returns data from the FDA Recall Enterprise System (RES), a database that contains information on recall event information submitted to FDA. Currently, this data covers publicly releasable records from 2004-present.

            The procedures followed to input recall information into RES when FDA learns of a recall event are outlined in Chapter 7 of FDA’s Regulatory Procedure Manual The Regulatory Procedures Manual is a reference manual for FDA personnel. It provides FDA personnel with information on internal procedures to be used in processing domestic and import regulatory and enforcement matters.

            Below chart is fetched using the data from United States Department of Health and Human Services via their public <a href="https://open.fda.gov/apis/food/enforcement/" target="_blank">API</a>.

            Numerical designation (I, II, or III) that is assigned by FDA to a particular product recall that indicates the relative degree of health hazard. -

                <li>
                    <b>Class I, a dangerous or defective product that predictably could cause serious health problems or death</b>
                    Dangerous or defective products that predictably could cause serious health problems or death. Examples include: food found to contain botulinum toxin, food with undeclared allergens, a label mix-up on a lifesaving drug, or a defective artificial heart valve.

                <li>
                    <b>Class II, meaning that the product might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature</b>
                    Products that might cause a temporary health problem, or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature. Example: a drug that is under-strength but that is not used to treat life-threatening situations.

                <li>
                    <b>Class III, a product that is unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violates FDA labeling or manufacturing laws.</b>
                    Products that are unlikely to cause any adverse health reaction, but that violate FDA labeling or manufacturing laws. Examples include: a minor container defect and lack of English labeling in a retail food
